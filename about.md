# TextureRework

Mod that aims to **change the ugly textures** in Geometry Dash, mainly changing the **gray lock** in **non-2.21 icons** and **player colors** to a **yellow lock**.

Thanks to **trufflo** from the **GD Modding** Discord for the **mod idea**, and to **km7dev** for help with the **2.21 icon detection logic**.
